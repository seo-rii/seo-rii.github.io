        What I made
    </h1>
    <p>Makes various programs. They create everything from algorithmic troubleshooting code to websites.</p>
    <a href="https://jungol.co.kr" target="_blank"><h3>Jungol</h3></a>
    <p>I renewed algorithm training website run by HancomEducation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I've redeveloped all services, including judger.</li>
        <li>The frontend is a MPA using a Svelte.</li>
        <li>Supports serverless execution of source code created based on WASM. It compiles C code on-device using wasm version of gcc/ld. It uses pyodide to run python code.</li>
        <li>Implemented LSP functionality to support intelligence in web editors.</li>
        <li>Backend was built using nodejs. It uses HonoJS framework.</li>
        <li>I implemented my own api query framework like tanstack-query. It supports e2e-type-safety, and optional SSR with easy config.</li>
        <li>I adopted the MSA structure.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/HancomAC/crunchy" target="_blank">Deployment tool</a> is also
            self-developed. It automatically creates dev preview when deployed on Github.
            I have automated entire system so that it can be distributed to the Production
            server with just one click of a button.
        </li>
        <li>The problem judger has been implemented by myself. Forked version named <a
                href="https://github.com/HancomAC/hana" target="_blank">HANA</a>
            is distributed under MIT license.
        </li>
        <li>The service is on the Google Cloud platform, and it actively utilized features like Pubsub, Arc, and GKE,
            not simple features like Compute Engine.
        </li>
        <li>I use Terraform to manage Infrastructure as Code.</li>
        <li>I use Sentry to collect error log automatically and fix it.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://codepass.co.kr" target="_blank"><h3>codepass</h3></a>
